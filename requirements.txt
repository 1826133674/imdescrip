#scipy
#numpy
#matplotlib
#cython

pyvlfeat 

# NOTE: for pyvlfeat I had to manually download this from pypi and change the
#   setup.py entry:
#
#       LinkArgs = ['-msse', '-shared', '-lboost_python-mt-py26']
#   to
#       LinkArgs = ['-msse', '-shared', '-lboost_python-mt-py27']
#
#   Then I could install this using "pip install -e [path to download]".
