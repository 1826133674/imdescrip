# These need to be installed using the package manager/system packages

# libboost_python
# libatlas-dev
# libatlas-base-dev
# libatlas3gf-base


# Some packages commented out are best got using your system package
#   tool/distribution. Only use pip for these if you must  

#scipy
#numpy
#matplotlib
#cython
#spams>=2.2     # See NOTE2

scikit-image
pyvlfeat    # See NOTE1 


# NOTE1: for pyvlfeat I had to manually download this from pypi and change the
#   setup.py entry:
#
#       LinkArgs = ['-msse', '-shared', '-lboost_python-mt-py26']
#   to
#       LinkArgs = ['-msse', '-shared', '-lboost_python-mt-py27']
#
#   Then I could install this using "sudo pip install [path to download]".
#
# NOTE2: spams is a manual install: 
#   
#   1) get the code from: http://spams-devel.gforge.inria.fr/index.html
#   2) install the libatlas dependencies
#   3) sudo pip install [download dir]
